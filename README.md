# tidy_data
In my script, I first import all relative dataset, and then I merge the train sets and test sets together.
After that, I replace the activity number with meaningful name.
Next, I compute the standard deviation and mean of the dataset.
Finally, I use dplyr package to get average value for each activity and subject.
